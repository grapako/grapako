## TL;DR
Astrophysicist working on spectral diagnostics of stellar atmospheres, currently with a focus on lines sensitive to chromospheric activity. I develop reproducible Python tools for spectral I/O, preprocessing and analysis, and I apply unsupervised clustering methods to classify spectral-line responses to activity. My short-term objective is to transition these skills toward AI applications in astrophysics and pursue a postdoctoral position that combines machine learning and stellar/exoplanetary spectroscopy.

## Current research & technical profile
- **Research focus:** spectral line formation in semi-empirical stellar atmospheres; classification of spectral lines sensitive to chromospheric activity.  
- **Methods:** deterministic radiative-transfer modelling, custom spectral pipelines (I/O, convolution, remapping, normalization), and **unsupervised clustering** (k-means, hierarchical clustering, DBSCAN) applied to spectral-feature vectors.  
- **Programming & tools:** Python (Anaconda / Spyder / VSCode), NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, small ML toolkits; experience packaging utilities for reuse.  
- **Goal:** apply this combined expertise in fundamental stellar physics and data analysis to the field of exoplanetary science. I'm currently deepening my knowledge in that field, and IA tools, to define a focused research project.

## What you will (soon) find here
I plan to publish a small, focused set of repositories that demonstrate reproducible pipelines and analysis:
- `jip-tools` — compact Python utilities for spectral I/O and preprocessing (I/O, convolution, remapping, export/import).  
- `spectral-clustering` — scripts and notebooks showing clustering pipelines (k-means, hierarchical, DBSCAN) applied to spectral-feature vectors and the resulting group interpretation.  
- `paper-figure-repro` — minimal repo to reproduce one figure from a selected paper (script + small example data / synthetic generator).

These will be added progressively. If you are interested in a specific item, contact me (email above) and I will prioritize that repo.

## Short note on license & citation (for future repos)
I typically use a **permissive license (MIT)** for code so others can reuse it easily; datasets may have separate restrictions. For academic reproducibility I add `CITATION.cff` when a release is published (optional for now).
